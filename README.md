## About Me
Hello! I'm Mohamed, a dedicated computer science student from Cairo studying at Zagazig National University. I've been on my programming journey for 2 years, starting with C++ and now mastering Python. My first project was a meaningful Quran Playlist application in C++, and I've since expanded my skills through structured learning and hands-on practice.

## 📚 My Learning Path
- **C++** (2 years experience) - Started with Quran Playlist project
- **Python** (from zero) - Focused on core programming concepts
- **Huawei Academy** at Egyptian Russian University (under Eng. Norhan Elnady)
